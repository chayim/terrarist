# Vaulties

A wrapper script for [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), making it easy to inject variables into a terraform run from an [ansible vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html). Ditto a vagrant wrapper, making it easier to drive vagrant and terraform from a single encrypted source.
